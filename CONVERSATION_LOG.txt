VIBEGAME DEVELOPMENT - CONVERSATION LOG
Session Date: January 28, 2026
=================================================

INTERACTION 001: Project Request
- User wanted 2D action RPG game with character builder
- Requested professional, production-quality code
- C++17 targeting Windows native + Steam/Xbox marketplace

INTERACTION 002: Project Scaffolding
- Created full C++17 project structure (30+ files)
- Integrated SFML 2.6.2 for graphics
- Integrated Lua 5.4.8 for scripting
- Integrated GLM 1.0.1 for math
- Built ECS (Entity-Component System) framework
- Character Builder: 8 races, 8 classes, 7 backgrounds, D&D stats, appearance customization
- Created CMakeLists.txt for cross-platform builds
- Setup working on WSL Fedora-43

INTERACTION 003: Bug Fixes
- Fixed CharacterBuilder const-correctness issue (mutable validationError)
- Fixed Lua 5.4 API incompatibility (luaL_tolstring)
- Disabled SFML graphics init in headless WSL environment (temporary workaround)

INTERACTION 004: GitHub Setup
- Generated Ed25519 SSH keypair
- Configured GitHub remote for uStackTrace/vibegame repo
- Verified SSH authentication working

INTERACTION 005: Development Strategy Discussion
- Confirmed Windows-native runtime target
- WSL Fedora-43 for editing/building (Linux familiarity preference)
- VSCode with Remote-WSL extension planned for IDE

INTERACTION 006: Windows Automation
- Created setup-windows-dev.ps1 (210 lines)
- 4-phase automation: prerequisites, vcpkg, CMake build, execution
- Handles MSVC setup, dependency installation, compilation

INTERACTION 007: Build Verification
- Confirmed CMake builds successfully on WSL (GCC)
- Character builder demo compiles and runs
- Ready for Windows native execution

INTERACTION 008: SSH Agent Configuration
- Configured SSH agent in ~/.bashrc for password persistence across session
- One-time password entry per terminal session

INTERACTION 009: Windows Build Launch
- Initiated setup-windows-dev.ps1 on Windows (MSVC compilation)

INTERACTION 010: Development Methodology
- Documented 3-tier update strategy:
  * Tier 1: Lua scripts (hot-reload during gameplay)
  * Tier 2: Component definitions (recompile)
  * Tier 3: Core engine (minimal changes required)
- Allows rapid iteration and modding support

INTERACTION 011: Audit Logging
- Created AUDIT_LOG.md in main vibegame repo (2000+ lines)
- Comprehensive change tracking, timestamps, decisions

INTERACTION 012: Repository Organization
- Organized git repositories under ~/git/:
  * ~/git/vibegame/ - Main development repo
  * ~/git/vibegame-audit/ - Conversation and audit tracking
- Both synchronized with GitHub remotes

INTERACTION 013: Conversation Tracking
- User requested complete conversation documented
- Focus on tax/regulatory compliance
- Moving forward with game development as primary objective
